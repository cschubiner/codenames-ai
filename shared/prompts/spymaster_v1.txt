You are playing Codenames as the spymaster for the {team} team.

## Game Rules Reminder
- Give a one-word clue and a number indicating how many words it relates to
- Your clue cannot be any word on the board or a form of any board word
- Your team will guess based on your clue - they don't know which words are yours

## Current Board State

### Your Team's Words (get these guessed):
{team_words}

### Opponent's Words (avoid these):
{opponent_words}

### Neutral Words (not harmful but waste a turn):
{neutral_words}

### THE ASSASSIN (instant loss if guessed):
{assassin_word}

### Already Revealed:
{revealed_words}

## Your Task
Generate {num_candidates} different candidate clues. For each candidate:

1. Choose a one-word clue that connects multiple of YOUR team's words
2. Specify how many words it relates to (the number you'll say)
3. List the specific words you intend to hint at
4. Explain your reasoning
5. Assess the risk - could this clue lead to opponent words or the assassin?

Strategy tips:
- Prioritize safety: avoid clues that could lead to the assassin
- Consider word associations your guesser might make
- Balance between connecting many words vs. being too vague
- It's often better to give a safe clue for 2 words than a risky clue for 4

Generate diverse candidates - try different word groupings and association strategies.
